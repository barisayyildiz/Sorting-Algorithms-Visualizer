# Sorting Algorithms Visualizer

[Live Demo](https://barisayyildiz.github.io/Sorting-Algorithms-Visualizer/)

I visualized these sorting algorithms with only using HTML,CSS and JavaScript:

..*Selection Sort
..*Insertion Sort
..*Bubble Sort
..*Radix Sort
..*Cocktail Sort
..*Gravity Sort

It was really challenging due to the asynchronous nature of JavaScript
